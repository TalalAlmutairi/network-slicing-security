# Intelligent Network Slicing Security Architecture

This project demonstrates a federated learning-based security model for 5G network slicing.

## Features
- Simulated federated anomaly detection
- Privacy-preserving data sharing
- Modular and scalable design

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Flask (for API simulation)

## Running the Simulation
```bash
cd src
python simulate_federated_learning.py
